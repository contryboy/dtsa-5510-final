This is the repo for DTSA-5510 final project.

It contains the following files:

* DTSA-5510 Final-Report.pdf:
  * The report of the project, same file as uploaded in peer review
* mnist-1-unsupervised-eda.ipynb:
  * Exploratory Data Analysis of the data, including statistics, plots, dimension reduction, etc.
* mnist-2-unsupervised-learning.ipynb
  * Expolor unsupervised learning models, anaylise the results and build a final model with test result generation.
* mnist-3-data-efficiency.ipynb
  * Assume we have limited amount of training data, and comparing the performance of supervised learning and unsupervised learning with training data for parameters selection.
* mnist-4-validation-of-data-efficiency.ipynb
  * To confirm what we concluded from the last notebook, we only use a labeled data set with 200 samples to predict the digits of the test data, if the result accuracy according to the conclusion.
